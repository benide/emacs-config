New repo with my emacs config converted from [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight]] to [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][elpaca]]. It's kind of a constant work in progress. While switching to elpaca, I decided to switch from helm-bibtex to citar, and that isn't quite done. There are some other little things that I tried to clean up while converting that aren't done too.
